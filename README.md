# Opencv-for-Imageprocessing
In this repository i will be including codes that i have written to aid in image processing .Image processing is an essential tools for reserachers who work in fields that reuqires critical analysis of images for reserach data.For instance i had to analysed my particle data to get their movement data and doing it manually is tedious because of the number of particles , number of images per second which we refer to as frames which could 30 per second or more. 
Each cell contains a code labelled with its function like image reading displays the image whose file path you have specified in the designated place.
I have also included key comments on instructions to change parameters : Like you need to change the kernel number only by an odd number.
These are topics for which i wrote the code:
